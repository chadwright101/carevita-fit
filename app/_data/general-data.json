What a great way to start the day. Having the dining hall right there also allows for some social time after class over a cup of tea/coffee and a healthy snack from the kiosk. There is also a class for the frail care residents every 2nd week. This class takes place every 2nd Tuesday at 10am. These classes are also held in the dining hall and the frail care residents are brought in by the nurses. This class is more focused on basic movements and mobility to assist the frail with safe exercises and general daily activities. The classes are instructed by Amanda Baird who has a great sense of humour paired with such compassion that the members just love coming back to her classes every week. Her exercises are also extremely effective ,so the results are felt surprisingly fast. Amanda changes her approach with the frail class to provide a much safer and gentler workout, however, her passion is still felt by all in the class as they like to sing a song to her after some of the classes.",
